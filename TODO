TODO LIST

 - pointing at shit
 - automatic value decoding
 - colours
 - design
 - lighting up character view with byte view
 - multiple annotation layers
 - sub byte annotations

Notes on multiple layers:
you'd explicitly assign them to layers
and if your annotation is contained within an annotation of a higher layer
you'd print out its description as well
so for instance, you see the two annotations starting at 0x70
StringID0 and StringID 1
you could define an annotation that contains all the StringIDs
on a higher layer
and call it "StringIDTable"
and then the description you see would say something like
  StringID 0, pointing to StringData at 0xe4 ("<init>")
  part of: StringID Table
and then you just make a constraint that annotations with the same layer level cannot overlap.
so at the JSON level, you just add a layer level to each annotation
and the rest of the work is done in presentation
